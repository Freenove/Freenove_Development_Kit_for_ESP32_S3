Component knowledge
==================================

MAX30102 is a module that integrates a pulse oximeter and biometric sensor for monitoring. It includes a red LED and an infrared LED, a photodetector, optical components, and low-noise electronic circuitry with ambient light suppression. It is typically used for heart rate and blood oxygen sensing in wearable devices, and can be worn on the fingertip, earlobe, and wrist.

The MAX30102 module uses the I2C communication interface to transmit the collected data to devices such as Arduino and ESP32 for heart rate and blood oxygen calculations.

When the MAX30102 is operating, it emits red and infrared light. As these lights pass through human tissue, the varying levels of light transmission caused by pulsating blood vessels can be detected by the module's photodetectors. These signals are then converted into electrical signals, amplified, and output to the main control chip.

To obtain the data, we only need to access the I2C address of the blood oxygen module using the I2C protocol. The default I2C address for MAX30102 is 0x57.

Sketch
============================

This code uses a library named "SparkFun_MAX3010x_Pulse_and_Proximity_Sensor_Library". If you have not installed it, please do so first.

How to install the library
--------------------------------

Open Arduino IDE, click Sketch -> Include Library -> Add .ZIP Library. In the pop-up window, find the file named " **Freenove-Development-Kit-for-ESP32-S3\\Libraries\\SparkFun_MAX3010x_Pulse_and_Proximity_Sensor_Library.Zip** " which locates in this directory, and click OPEN.

Calculate the number of heartbeats per minute and the average number of heartbeats.

We need to consider the fluctuation of data caused by factors such as the location and area of our finger that is in contact with the MAX30102 during each measurement. Therefore, it is more accurate to use the method of summing up and averaging the data to obtain a person's heart rate
